// ** IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS **

// Hey there! :)
// I hope you will be doing great and I hope this code will help you in any way :)
// So all the other code is easy to understand because it 
// doesn't follow any complex architecture ;p so I didn't added any comments in it.
// Which are pretty importatnt to add when you are sharing your code. So you should 
// add comments in your code I am just a little lazy. 
//
// OK Back to the main topic. This file contains most of the core logic behind 
// the app's major functionality. I will try to explain every block in it so it will 
// be easy to follow along for you. Let's get started...

// So main functionality of the app is that it runs in background and detects or 
// listens for a phone shake and when that event happens it send sos message to 
// the selected contacts of the user.
// So main thing here is to set up a background isolate which will work in 
// background and will listen to shake events no matter the app is closed 
// or in background or foreground. 

// For that I have used ->  flutter_background_service: ^0.1.5
// Which is a very handy plugin to run our dart code in background.


// This function starts background isolates which is called when the app starts
// in main method and this will instantiate the background service and 
// then will listen  for updates. 
void onStart() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final service = FlutterBackgroundService();

  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();

  // I have instanciated the service object above and here I am just 
  // making a stream to listen for the events
  service.onDataReceived.listen((event) async {
    if (event["action"] == "setAsForeground") {
      service.setForegroundMode(true);

      return;
    }

    if (event["action"] == "setAsBackground") {
      service.setForegroundMode(false);
    }

    if (event["action"] == "stopService") {
      service.stopBackgroundService();
    }
  });
  Location _location;
// This is another handy plugin whcih works in background independently and fetches the 
// user location as we need location for some of the functionalities. Initially it will 
// show a notification to user that the service is running 
// this is important so that the user does know that the app is tracking his/her location.


  await BackgroundLocation.setAndroidNotification(
    title: "Location tracking is running in the background!",
    message: "You can turn it off from settings menu inside the app",
    icon: '@mipmap/ic_logo',
  );

  // This is where the location service gets started.
  BackgroundLocation.startLocationService(
    distanceFilter: 20,
  );

  // Its pretty easy to get location updates. As this method will only 
  // be called when there are some location updates. and will save the data 
  // in Shared Preferences. 

  // ** IMPORTANT CONCEPT ** 
  // When working with isolates we need to comunicate data through ports because unlike 
  // threads isolates does not share any memory.
  // Here I am usong shared preferences to save data because 
  // I dont need the data actively but need on specific time intervals. 
  // So instead for passing it to a port and listen to it continously I had managed it 
  // through shared preferences and worker plugin to get the updates after specific 
  // time when needed. 
  // Now you will think that it can be possible through ports too but why do it the hard 
  // way when it can be done easily :)
  // 
  BackgroundLocation.getLocationUpdates((location) {
    _location = location;

        [location.latitude.toString(), location.longitude.toString()]);

  // threshold to 7, to avoid unnecessery shakes which can be cause by mistake
